I started seeing this bug immediately after switching from running Hudson under
Glassfish to running it on its own using java -jar.

I also upgraded several versions of Hudson in the process, so it might be
something to do with the new version. But it looks suspiciously like the plugin
may be depending upon some feature of Glassfish.
