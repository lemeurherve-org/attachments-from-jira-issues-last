  jQuery UI Upgrade
------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgraded:
    - jQuery Core to 1.8.3 from 1.7.1
    - jQuery UI to 1.9.2 from 1.8.16

Avoided:
    - Upgrading jQueryMobile to 1.2
    - Touching Portal or Mobile or Basic

Good Points:
    - Seems slightly more fluid, which is good, meaning dialogs don't take so long to flicker into correct place (though maybe I'm seeing things), accordion slides a bit nicer, etc.
    - Accessibility improvements in areas noted below.

Testing:
    - Tested each feature in IE7/9/Chrome/FF
    - Tested iOS4/5/6/Surface
    - Unit tests will be forthcoming

General Notes:
---------------------------------------------
- Systematically compared CSS for the upgrade to ensure nothing was added/missed in the upgrade to 1.9.2
    - Merged in few spotfixes we had inserted in past.
- Disabled the 1.8 API, preferring the 1.9 API for upgrading to limit our problems in the future. (http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#overview)
    - 1.10 will disable these API's so we should do it right now
- widget.('destroy') method prior to instantiating widgets caused some problems
    - Unclear why we were always doing this before, doesn't seem real necessary
    - Refactored out of the code for now in problem areas.
    - Modified the docTabs draggable ('destroy') as it was throwing an error on page render.
    - Confirmed that other instances of ('destroy') don't need to be modified, especially on the jquery UI widgets that were causing problems.

Widget Notes:
---------------------------------------------
- Upgraded Accordion
    - Made styling tweaks to make it the same again.
    - Made changes for API changes in the JS specifically for active panes on open/page load
    - Accessibility improvements for tabbing
- Upgraded Autocomplete
    - Refactored to use new internal functions for jqueryUI changes
    - Removed custom widget and instead just used internal function override function found on jQueryUI example
    - Major Accessibility improvements
- Confirmed .widget() API changes do not impact our current code
    - Since I refactored the one instance of this (autocomplete) we no longer have to worry about these
- Upgraded Dialog API
    - Removed 'destroy' from the generic dialog setup, shouldn't be needed anyways but a note nonetheless.
    - 'beforeclose' option changed to 'beforeClose' due to API change.
    - Major Accessibility improvements
- Confirmed Position API changes do not impact our current code
- Upgraded Tabs API
    - Accessibility improvements
- Confirmed that other external plugins not affected by changes

Comment:
  Adding a polling interaction for the document tray status.  This approach needs to be further validated.  Adding conditionals to show or hide the temporary doc tray placeholder as well as the temporary highlighting that acts as an indicator of the doc tray containing in progress items.
