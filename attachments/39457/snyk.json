      "description": "## Overview\n[`tunnel-agent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tunnel-agent) is HTTP proxy tunneling agent. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Uninitialized Memory Exposure. \n\nA possible memory disclosure vulnerability exists when a value of type `number` is used to set the _proxy.auth_ option of a request `request` and results in a possible uninitialized memory exposures in the request body.\n\nThis is a result of unobstructed use of the `Buffer` constructor, whose [insecure default constructor increases the odds of memory leakage](https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/).\n\n## Details\nConstructing a `Buffer` class with integer `N` creates a `Buffer` of length `N` with raw (not \"zero-ed\") memory.\n\nIn the following example, the first call would allocate 100 bytes of memory, while the second example will allocate the memory needed for the string \"100\":\n```js\n// uninitialized Buffer of length 100\nx = new Buffer(100);\n// initialized Buffer with value of '100'\nx = new Buffer('100');\n```\n\n`tunnel-agent`'s `request` construction uses the default `Buffer` constructor as-is, making it easy to append uninitialized memory to an existing list. If the value of the buffer list is exposed to users, it may expose raw server side memory, potentially holding secrets, private data and code. This is a similar vulnerability to the infamous [`Heartbleed`](http://heartbleed.com/) flaw in OpenSSL.\n\n#### Proof of concept by ChALkeR\n```js\nrequire('request')({\n  method: 'GET',\n  uri: 'http://www.example.com',\n  tunnel: true,\n  proxy:{\n      protocol: 'http:',\n      host:\"127.0.0.1\",\n      port:8080,\n      auth:80\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou can read more about the insecure `Buffer` behavior [on our blog](https://snyk.io/blog/exploiting-buffer/).\n\nSimilar vulnerabilities were discovered in [request](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:request:20160119), [mongoose](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:mongoose:20160116), [ws](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20160104) and [sequelize](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:sequelize:20160115).\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `tunnel-agent` to version 0.6.0 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [PoC by ChALkeR](https://gist.github.com/ChALkeR/fd6b2c445834244e7d440a043f9d2ff4)\n- [Github Commit](https://github.com/request/tunnel-agent/commit/9ca95ec7219daface8a6fc2674000653de0922c0)\n",

Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) approximate randomness algorithmically, starting with a seed from which subsequent values are calculated.\n\nThere are two types of PRNGs: statistical and cryptographic. Statistical PRNGs provide useful statistical properties, but their output is highly predictable and forms an easy to reproduce numeric stream that is unsuitable for use in cases where security depends on generated values being unpredictable. Cryptographic PRNGs address this problem by generating output that is more difficult to predict. For a value to be cryptographically secure, it must be impossible or highly improbable for an attacker to distinguish between it and a truly random value. In general, if a PRNG algorithm is not advertised as being cryptographically secure, then it is probably a statistical PRNG and should not be used in security-sensitive contexts.\n\nYou can read more about node's insecure `Math.random()` in [Mike Malone's post](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d).\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `ws` to version 1.1.2 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/832)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/7253f06f5432c76f3e82e2c055fcea08b612d8b2)\n- [Mike Malone's Blog](https://medium.com/@betable/tifu-by-using-math-random-f1c308c4fd9d#.6wcldperq)\n",
